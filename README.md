# DiscordThemes
Themes I've made for Discord.

## Showcase
### [Eminent](https://github.com/a7xuma/DiscordThemes/tree/main/Eminent)
Eminent is a dark purple Discord theme using a modified "blurple" (blue and purple) color scheme. It is intended to be easy on the eyes and very simple, only editing the default Discord variables and adding a minimal amount of custom CSS.
